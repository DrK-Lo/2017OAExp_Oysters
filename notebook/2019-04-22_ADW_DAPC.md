# Created and updated DAPC analysis

Updated [DAPC Analysis](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2017OAExp_Oysters/blob/master/markdown_files/STAR_pipeline/04B_CV17_RNA_DAPC.md)

Contains:
* Cumulative variance plots 
  * Not clear based on plots what the best number of clusters is best for the DAPC analysis
  * To low and the resulting discriminant function has minimum explainatory power
  * To high and the discriminant function is over fitted 
* Decided to try cluster thresholds of 5,10, and 15.
* Created a discriminant function based on both time and treatment for out entire dataset and ploted each treatment time combination separately.
  
 Results:
 Unclear what the best number of clusters is for this analysis. This appears to significantly affect the outcome and interpretation of the discriminant function and figures.
