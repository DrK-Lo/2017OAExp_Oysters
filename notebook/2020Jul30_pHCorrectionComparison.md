# Analysis comparing the impact of the pH correction on statistical analysis

**Overview**: Elise discovered that the EPF pH and seawater pH likely needed to be corrected to account for the fact that they were measured using different types of probes. Based on this, two primary corrections were performed to convert the seawater and EPF pH measurements to either **Total** or **NBS** scale. In the link below is a quick analysis which examine the impact these changes have on the final results in the AE17 manuscript.
